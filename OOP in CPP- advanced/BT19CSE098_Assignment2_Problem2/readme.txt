COMPILATION DONE IN DEV C++ Platform.
Description of problem:using operator overloading,perform some tasks like (+)add,(-)sub,etc for complex numbers on via class objects
----------------------                       

In ComplexInteger.h :
--------------------
        I have defined class ComplexInteger with data members,constructor,destructor,copy constructor,setter and getter methods,binary and unary operator overloading and friend function

In ComplexInteger.cpp :
-----------------------
       I have included ComplexInteger.h and defined all functions,operator overloading,constructor,friend function etc.

In main.cpp:
------------
        I have included ComplexInteger.h and I created objects and user gives the input.Using setter method complex integers are created and gave an option for user to select task and based
        on that appropriate function and operator overloading is called.
